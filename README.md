# Quiver

> Your quiver of arrows to declaratively render arrows in HTML. Connect an arrow to HTML elements via CSS selectors and this library will automatically track the movement and resizing of those elements and update the arrow accordingly. Your quiver comes with a growing number of types of arrows and the tools to easily create your own!

> [!WARNING]  
> This library is still in development. ðŸš§ Use at your own risk. It's not published to npm yet. Expect breaking changes until we flesh things out.

Documentation is WIP, in the meantime check out the [demos](https://github.com/Little-Languages/quiver/tree/main/demo) for how to use this library and to see the existing types of arrows in action.
