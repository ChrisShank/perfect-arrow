## API

### Required attributes/properties

- `source`: A CSS selector for the element that is the source of the arrow.
- `target`: A CSS selector for the element that is the target of the arrow.

### Optional attributes/properties

- `type`: The type of layout algorithm to use: 'box' or 'point'. See `perfect-arrows`'s [`getBoxToBoxArrow`](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-arrows/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#getboxtoboxarrowx0-y0-w0-h0-x1-y1-w1-h1-options) and [`getArrow`](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-arrows/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#getarrowx0-y0-x1-y1-options), respectively.
- `bow`: A value representing the natural bow of the arrow. At `0`, all lines will be straight.
- `stretch`: The effect that the arrow's length will have, relative to its `minStretch` and `maxStretch`, on the bow of the arrow. At `0`, the stretch will have no effect.
- `stretch-min`: The length of the arrow where the line should be most stretched. Shorter distances than this will have no additional effect on the bow of the arrow.
- `stretch-max`: The length of the arrow at which the stretch should have no effect.
- `pad-start`: How far the arrow's starting point should be from the provided start point.
- `pad-end`: How far the arrow's ending point should be from the provided end point.
- `flip`: Whether to reflect the arrow's bow angle.
- `straights`: Whether to use straight lines at 45 degree angles.
