# Perfect Arrow

> A custom element to declaratively define arrows between HTML elements. Steve Ruiz's [perfect-arrows](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-arrows) powers to arrow layout and Sam Thor's [viz-observer](https://github.com/samthor/viz-observer) to observer the movement and resizing of elements.

> This library is still in development. ðŸš§ Use at your own risk. It's also not published to NPM yet.

## Usage

1. Install the NPM package [`perfect-arrow`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/perfect-arrow) using a package manager of your choice.

2. Register the custom element and start using it in HTML

```html
<div id="box1"></div>
<div id="box2"></div>
<perfect-arrow type="box" source="box1" target="box2"></perfect-arrow>

<script type="module">
  import { PerfectArrow } from 'perfect-arrow';

  // Register the `<perfect-arrow>` custom element.
  PerfectArrow.register();
</script>
```

## API

### Required attributes/properties

- `source`: (`String`) A CSS selector for the element that is the source of the arrow.
- `target`: (`String`) A CSS selector for the element that is the target of the arrow.

### Optional attributes/properties

- `type`: (`String`) The type of layout algorithm to use. `'box'` will render the arrow around the border-box of each element. `'point'` will render the arrow on the midpoint of each element. tab=readme-ov-file#getboxtoboxarrowx0-y0-w0-h0-x1-y1-w1-h1-options) and [`getArrow`](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-arrows/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#getarrowx0-y0-x1-y1-options), respectively.
- `bow`: (`Number`) A value representing the natural bow of the arrow. At `0`, all lines will be straight.
- `stretch`: (`Number`) The effect that the arrow's length will have, relative to its `minStretch` and `maxStretch`, on the bow of the arrow. At `0`, the stretch will have no effect.
- `stretch-min`: (`Number`) The length of the arrow where the line should be most stretched. Shorter distances than this will have no additional effect on the bow of the arrow.
- `stretch-max`: (`Number`) The length of the arrow at which the stretch should have no effect.
- `pad-start`: (`Number`) How far the arrow's starting point should be from the provided start point.
- `pad-end`: (`Number`) How far the arrow's ending point should be from the provided end point.
- `flip`: (`Boolean`) Whether to reflect the arrow's bow angle.
- `straights`: (`Boolean`) Whether to use straight lines at 45 degree angles.

#### Default values

Here are the default values of optional attributes

```html
<perfect-arrow
  type="box"
  bow="0"
  stretch=".25"
  stretch-min="50"
  stretch-max="420"
  pad-start="0"
  pad-end="20"
  straights
></perfect-arrow>
```

### Extensibility

The custom element is easily extensible via class inheritance. You can update the name of the custom element, add new properties/attributes, override the render method, and add new arrow algorithms.

```ts
import { PerfectArrow } from 'perfect-arrow';
import { property } from '@lit/reactive-element/decorators.js';

class MyArrow extends PerfectArrow {
  // Override the name of the custom element
  static tagName = 'my-arrow';

  // Add your own properties/attributes. For example, a weighted edge.
  @property({ type: Number, reflect: true }) weight: number = 0;

  // Render an arrow with your own styles!
  render([sx, sy, cx, cy, ex, ey, ae]: Arrow) {
    // ...
  }
}

MyArrow.register();
```
